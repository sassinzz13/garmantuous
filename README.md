# Garmantuous manga reader  
Made in flutter as my first project, currently in development. Garmantuous is an aesthetic and clean manga reader
made to give users a minimalist experience in user interface design for them to focus more on reading.  

To run the app simply connect a phone to your laptop/desktop, enter developer mode and turn on *USB debugging*  then do ```flutter run``` in the terminal  
make sure to have the flutter sdk installed on your system, you can simply do that by going to their website or via android studio.
